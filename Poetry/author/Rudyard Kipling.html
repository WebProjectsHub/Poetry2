<b>Rudyard Kipling</b> was born on December 30, 1865 in Bombay, India, to John Lockwood Kipling, an artist and scholar, and Alice MacDonald, who belonged to a family of prominent British artists and politicians. He spent his early childhood in India, where he was exposed to the rich culture and languages of the country. He was sent to England at the age of six to be educated, but he suffered from neglect and abuse at the hands of his foster parents. He later attended the United Services College, a boarding school for military cadets, where he developed his love for literature and writing.
<br><br>

In 1882, he returned to India and worked as a journalist for various Anglo-Indian newspapers. He also began to publish his poems and stories, which drew inspiration from his experiences and observations of colonial life. He gained fame and popularity for his witty and imaginative tales of adventure, romance, and fantasy, such as "The Man Who Would Be King", "The Phantom Rickshaw", and "Plain Tales from the Hills". He also wrote patriotic and martial poems, such as "Gunga Din", "Mandalay", and "Barrack-Room Ballads", which celebrated the British soldiers in India.
<br><br>

In 1892, he married Caroline Balestier, an American, and moved to Vermont, USA, where he wrote some of his most famous works for children, such as "The Jungle Book", "Just So Stories", and "Captains Courageous". He also wrote his first novel, "The Light That Failed", which was based on his own failed romance. He became friends with many American writers and intellectuals, such as Mark Twain, Henry James, and Theodore Roosevelt.
<br><br>

In 1896, he moved back to England after a dispute with his brother-in-law. He settled in Sussex, where he continued to write prolifically. He also travelled extensively around the world, visiting countries such as South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Egypt. He wrote about his impressions and opinions of these places in his travelogues, such as "From Sea to Sea" and "Letters of Travel". He also wrote historical and political essays, such as "The White Man's Burden", which advocated for British imperialism and its civilizing mission.
<br><br>

In 1901, he published his masterpiece novel, "Kim", which is set in India and depicts the adventures of an orphan boy who becomes involved in the Great Game of espionage between Britain and Russia. The novel is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of English literature and a classic of Orientalism. It showcases Kipling's deep knowledge and appreciation of Indian culture and religion.
<br><br>

In 1907, he became the first English-language writer to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was also offered the British Poet Laureateship and a knighthood, but he declined both. He was widely respected and admired by his contemporaries and the public as a literary genius and a national icon.
<br><br>

However, his reputation suffered a decline after World War I, when his jingoistic and imperialistic views became unpopular and criticized by the emerging modernist writers and critics. He also faced personal tragedies, such as the death of his daughter Josephine from pneumonia in 1899 and his son John from combat in 1915. He became increasingly isolated and bitter in his later years.
<br><br>

He died on January 18, 1936 in London from a brain hemorrhage. He was buried at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. His legacy remains controversial and debated, but he is also recognized as a master storyteller and a major influence on English literature.
