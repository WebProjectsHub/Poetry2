				<p15>
Born in York, England, in 1907, <b>Wystan Hugh Auden</b> initially dreamt of becoming a scientist. However, his love for literature blossomed while studying English at Oxford. Here, he befriended other future literary giants like Stephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood, forming a group known as the "Auden Generation."
<br><br>

<b>Political Leanings and Early Success</b><br>
Auden's early poetry addressed social and political issues, often reflecting socialist and Freudian ideologies. His 1930 publication, "Poems," solidified his reputation as a leading voice of his generation.
<br><br>

<b>Travels and Shifting Worldviews</b><br>
Between 1928 and 1939, Auden traveled extensively, visiting Germany, Iceland, and China. He witnessed the rise of fascism and became disillusioned with his initial political beliefs. In 1939, he emigrated to the United States, marking a turning point in his life and work.
<br><br>

<b>American Influence and Later Years</b><br>
In America, Auden's focus shifted towards religious themes and moral anxieties. He collaborated with composers like Leonard Bernstein and explored various forms of writing, including librettos, opera, and film scripts. He also gained widespread recognition, winning the Pulitzer Prize for "The Age of Anxiety" in 1948.
<br><br>

<b>Legacy and Lasting Impact</b><br>
