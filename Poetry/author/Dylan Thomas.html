<b>Dylan Marlais Thomas</b> (October 27, 1914 – November 9, 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems "Do not go gentle into that good night" and "And death shall have no dominion", as well as the "play for voices" Under Milk Wood. He also wrote stories and radio broadcasts such as A Child's Christmas in Wales and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog. He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then, he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a "roistering, drunken and doomed poet".
<br><br>

<b>Early life</b><br>
Thomas was born in Swansea, Wales, to David John Thomas, an English literature professor, and Florence Annie Thomas (née Williams). He was the youngest of three children. Thomas's father was a strong influence on his early development, and he instilled in his son a love of language and literature. Thomas also spent a great deal of time in the Welsh countryside, which would later become a source of inspiration for his poetry.
<br><br>

<b>Career</b><br>
Thomas left school at the age of 16 to become a junior reporter for the South Wales Daily Post. He continued to write poetry during this time, and his early work was published in various magazines and journals. In 1934, Thomas's poem "Light breaks where no sun shines" was published in The Criterion, and it brought him to the attention of the literary world.
<br><br>

In 1937, Thomas married Caitlin Macnamara, and they had three children together. Thomas continued to write poetry and prose, and he also began to give public readings of his work. His readings were often highly theatrical, and he became known for his passionate delivery.
<br><br>

<b>Death</b><br>
Thomas died in New York City on November 9, 1953, at the age of 39. The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage, which was likely brought on by his lifelong struggle with alcoholism.
<br><br>

<b>Legacy</b><br>
Thomas's poetry is characterized by its lyrical intensity, its use of rich imagery, and its exploration of themes of death, love, and loss. His work has been translated into many languages, and it continues to be read and studied by audiences around the world.
<br><br>

Thomas's life and work have been the subject of several biographies, films, and plays. He is also the namesake of the Dylan Thomas Centre in Swansea, which is a museum dedicated to his life and work.
<br><br>

<b>Influence</b><br>
Thomas's work has had a significant influence on many other poets, including Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, and Sylvia Plath. His work has also been praised by critics such as T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden.
<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Dylan Thomas was a major figure in 20th-century poetry. His work is characterized by its lyrical intensity, its use of rich imagery, and its exploration of themes of death, love, and loss. Thomas's poetry continues to be read and studied by audiences around the world, and he is considered one of the most important poets of his generation.
