<b id="structure">Structure</b><br>
The poem consists of four lines that form a single stanza. The first line is repeated at the end of the poem, creating a circular structure that emphasizes the idea of facing death again and again.
<br><br>

<b id="form">Form</b><br>
The poem follows the form of a quatrain, which is a four-line stanza with a rhyme scheme. Quatrains are common in English poetry and can convey a variety of moods and tones.
<br><br>

<b id="rhythm">Rhythm</b><br>
The poem has a regular rhythm that creates a sense of urgency and determination. The rhythm is based on the number of syllables and stresses in each line. The first and third lines have eight syllables and four stresses, while the second and fourth lines have six syllables and three stresses.
<br><br>

<b id="rhyme">Rhyme scheme</b><br>
The poem has an ABAB rhyme scheme, which means that the first and third lines rhyme with each other, and the second and fourth lines rhyme with each other. The rhyme scheme creates a sense of harmony and closure in the poem.
<br><br>

<b id="meter">Meter</b><br>
The poem has a mixed meter that alternates between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter. An iamb is a metrical foot that consists of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable, such as “into”. A tetrameter is a line that has four metrical feet, while a trimeter is a line that has three metrical feet. The meter can be marked as follows:
<br><br>
	<blockquote>
	<i>iambic tetrameter		</i><br>
	Once more in|to the fray	<br>
	<i>iambic trimeter		</i><br>
	In|to the last |good fight I’ll ev|er know	<br>
	<i>iambic tetrameter		</i><br>
	Live and die |on this day	<br>
	<i>iambic trimeter		</i><br>
	Live and die |on this day	<br><br>
	</blockquote>

<b id="theme">Themes</b><br>
The poem explores the themes of courage, survival, death, and fate. The speaker of the poem is facing a life-threatening situation, possibly involving wild animals or enemies, as suggested by the word “fray”. The speaker accepts that this might be his last fight, but he does not give up or surrender. He chooses to live and die on this day, implying that he will fight with all his strength and will until the end. The poem also suggests that the speaker believes in fate or destiny, as he does not question why he has to face this challenge or what will happen after his death. He simply embraces his fate with courage and dignity.
<br><br>

<b id="diction">Diction</b><br>
The poem uses simple and direct words that convey a sense of realism and immediacy. The words are mostly monosyllabic or disyllabic, such as “fray”, “fight”, “live”, “die”, “day”. The only exception is the word “ever”, which adds emphasis to the phrase “the last good fight I’ll ever know”. The words are also concrete and specific, rather than abstract or vague, such as “the fray”, “the last good fight”, “this day”. The words create a clear image of what the speaker is facing and how he feels about it.
<br><br>

<b id="syntax">Syntax</b><br>
The poem uses short and simple sentences that follow a subject-verb-object structure. The sentences are declarative, rather than interrogative or exclamatory, which shows the speaker’s confidence and certainty. The sentences are also parallel, meaning that they have the same grammatical structure and pattern, such as “live and die on this day”. The parallelism creates a sense of balance and rhythm in the poem.
