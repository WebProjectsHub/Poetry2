The first stanza describes the arrival of the visitor as a "tremendous feat". This suggests that the arrival of this person is a significant event that will have a major impact on the speaker's life.

This suggests that the visitor is a complex and multifaceted individual who brings their own baggage with them. The phrase "the wind that broke through my window" suggests that the visitor is someone who has the potential to disrupt the speaker's life.
<br><br>

<b>Stanza 3</b><br>
The third stanza describes the visitor as someone who "comes with a heart that has been broken". This suggests that the visitor is someone who has been through pain and suffering, but who is still capable of love and connection. The phrase "can my heart mimic that wind" suggests that the speaker is open to the possibility of healing and transformation.
<br><br>

The poem ends with the speaker wondering if their heart can "mimic that wind" and become a "hospitable place" for the visitor. This suggests that the speaker is willing to take a risk and open themselves up to the possibility of connection.
<br><br>
