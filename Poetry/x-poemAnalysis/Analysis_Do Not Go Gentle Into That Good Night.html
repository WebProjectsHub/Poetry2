<b id="structure">Structure</b><br>
The structure of the poem is the way it is organized into stanzas and lines. The poem has 19 lines, divided into six stanzas. The first five stanzas are tercets (three-line stanzas), and the last stanza is a quatrain (four-line stanza). The structure of the poem follows a strict form called a villanelle, which consists of five tercets and a quatrain, with the first and third lines of the first tercet repeated alternately as the last line of each subsequent tercet, and both repeated as the last two lines of the final quatrain.
<br><br>

<b id="form">Form</b><br>
The form of the poem is the type of poem it is, based on its structure, rhyme scheme, and meter. The poem is a villanelle, which is a type of fixed form that originated in France in the 16th century. A villanelle has 19 lines, with two refrains and two rhymes. The refrains are the first and third lines of the first tercet, which are repeated alternately as the last line of each subsequent tercet, and both repeated as the last two lines of the final quatrain. The rhyme scheme is ABA for the tercets and ABAA for the quatrain. The meter is usually iambic pentameter or tetrameter, but can vary.
<br><br>

<b id="rhythm">Rhythm</b><br>
The rhythm of the poem is the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in each line. The rhythm creates a musical effect and reinforces the meaning and mood of the poem. The poem has a consistent rhythm throughout, using iambic pentameter as its meter. An iamb is a pair of syllables, with the first one unstressed and the second one stressed, such as “a-bove”. Pentameter means that there are five iambs in each line, such as “Do not / go gen / tle in / to that / good night”. The rhythm creates a sense of urgency and insistence, as the speaker commands his father to resist death.
<br><br>

<b id="rhyme">Rhyme scheme</b><br>
The rhyme scheme of the poem is the pattern of rhymes at the end of each line. The rhyme scheme creates a sound effect and connects different lines and stanzas together. The poem has a fixed rhyme scheme throughout, using only two rhymes in the entire poem: night/light and day/they/bay/gay. The rhyme scheme is ABA for the tercets and ABAA for the quatrain, where A rhymes with night/light and B rhymes with day/they/bay/gay. The rhyme scheme creates a sense of harmony and continuity, as well as contrast between darkness and light.
<br><br>

<b id="meter">Meter</b><br>
The meter of the poem is the number and type of feet in each line. A foot is a unit of rhythm that consists of one stressed syllable and one or more unstressed syllables. There are different types of feet, such as iamb, trochee, anapest, dactyl, spondee, and pyrrhic. The meter creates a rhythmic structure and affects the pace and tone of the poem. The meter of the poem is iambic pentameter, which means that each line has five pairs of unstressed and stressed syllables, such as “Do not / go gen / tle in / to that / good night”. Iambic pentameter is one of the most common meters in English poetry, especially in sonnets and blank verse. It creates a natural and balanced rhythm that matches human speech.
<br><br>

<b id="theme">Themes</b><br>
The themes of the poem are the main ideas or messages that it conveys. The themes reflect the poet’s views on life, death, and human nature. The poem explores several themes, such as death and defiance, family and grief, and old age and wisdom. Death and defiance are the main themes of the poem, as the speaker urges his father to resist death and fight for life until the end. He also expresses his admiration for different types of men who lived passionately and bravely, even though they knew that death was inevitable. He contrasts the darkness of death with the light of life, and uses metaphors of fire and stars to suggest vitality and intensity. Family and grief are another theme of the poem, as the speaker reveals his personal emotions of love, sorrow, and fear as he faces the loss of his father. He also addresses his father directly in some lines, such as “And you, my father” (line 16) and “I pray” (line 17), creating a sense of intimacy and urgency. Old age and wisdom are another theme of the poem, as the speaker acknowledges that his father is old and near death, but also argues that old age should not be a reason to give up on life. He also praises the wisdom of men who knew that “dark is right” (line 4) and “words had forked no lightning” (line 5), but still challenged the darkness and the silence with their deeds and words.
<br><br>

<b id="diction">Diction</b><br>
The diction of the poem is the choice and use of words and phrases. The diction creates a tone and style that reflect the poet’s voice and attitude. The poem uses simple but powerful words to convey its message, such as “rage”, “burn”, “blaze”, “curse”, and “bless”. The speaker uses imperative sentences to command his father to “Do not go gentle” and to “Rage, rage against the dying of the light”. He also uses parallelism to list the different types of men who did not accept death easily: “wise men”, “good men”, “wild men”, and “grave men”. He uses anaphora to repeat the words “Do not go gentle” and “Rage, rage” at the beginning of each stanza, creating a sense of urgency and insistence. He also uses alliteration to emphasize certain sounds, such as “g” in “go gentle” and “good night”, “d” in “dark is right” and “dying of the light”, and “b” in “blind eyes could blaze”. He also uses imagery to create vivid pictures in the reader’s mind, such as “words had forked no lightning”, “frail deeds might have danced in a green bay”, “caught and sang the sun in flight”, and “blind eyes could blaze like meteors”.
<br><br>

<b id="syntax">Syntax</b><br>
The syntax of the poem is the arrangement and order of words and phrases. The syntax affects the meaning and clarity of the poem, as well as its rhythm and rhyme. The poem uses a variety of syntactic devices to enhance its form and content, such as inversion, repetition, parallelism, anaphora, alliteration, and imagery. Inversion is the reversal of the normal word order, such as “grave men, near death” (line 13) instead of “men near death, grave”. Repetition is the use of the same word or phrase more than once, such as “Do not go gentle” and “Rage, rage”. Parallelism is the use of similar grammatical structures for related words or phrases, such as “wise men … good men … wild men … grave men”. Anaphora is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or lines, such as “Do not go gentle” and “Rage, rage”. Alliteration is the repetition of the same consonant sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words, such as “go gentle” and “good night”. Imagery is the use of figurative language to create sensory impressions, such as “words had forked no lightning” and “blind eyes could blaze like meteors”.
