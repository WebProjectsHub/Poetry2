				<hp5>
Go placidly amid the noise and haste,				<br>
and remember what peace there may be in silence.		<br>
As far as possible without surrender				<br>
be on good terms with all persons.				<br>
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;				<br>
and listen to others,						<br>
even the dull and the ignorant;					<br>
they too have their story.					<br><br>

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,				<br>
they are vexations to the spirit.				<br>
If you compare yourself with others,				<br>
you may become vain and bitter;					<br>
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.	<br>
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.				<br><br>

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;			<br>
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.		<br>
Exercise caution in your business affairs;				<br>
for the world is full of trickery.					<br>
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;			<br>
many persons strive for high ideals;					<br>
and everywhere life is full of heroism.					<br><br>

Be yourself.								<br>
Especially, do not feign affection.					<br>
Neither be cynical about love;						<br>
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment			<br>
it is as perennial as the grass.					<br><br>

Take kindly the counsel of the years,					<br>
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.				<br>
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.		<br>
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.			<br>
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.				<br>
Beyond a wholesome discipline,						<br>
be gentle with yourself.						<br><br>

You are a child of the universe,					<br>
no less than the trees and the stars;					<br>
you have a right to be here.						<br>
And whether or not it is clear to you,					<br>
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.			<br><br>

Therefore be at peace with God,						<br>
whatever you conceive Him to be,					<br>
and whatever your labors and aspirations,				<br>
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.		<br><br>

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,				<br>
it is still a beautiful world.						<br>
Be cheerful.								<br>
Strive to be happy.							<br>
