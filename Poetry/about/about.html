				<h6>About Ars Poetica</h6>
			</div>
			<div id="contents">
				<p15>
Welcome to <a href="../Poetry.html"><b>Ars Poetica</b></a>, a website dedicated to the art of poetry. Here you will find poems, essays, reviews and resources that explore the craft and beauty of poetic expression. Whether you are a poet, a student, a teacher, or a lover of poetry, you will find something to inspire and enrich your appreciation of this ancient and ever-evolving art form.
<br><br>

The name of our website comes from a Latin phrase that means <i>"the art of poetry"</i>. It is also the title of a famous poem by Archibald MacLeish, who wrote: <i>"A poem should not mean / But be."</i> This poem reflects the modernist view that poetry should be self-referential and autonomous, rather than mimetic and didactic. However, the phrase <b>Ars Poetica</b> also refers to an earlier work by Horace, a Roman poet who wrote a letter to his friends offering advice on how to write good poetry. Horace emphasized the importance of pleasing and instructing the audience, as well as following the rules of genre, style, and decorum.
<br><br>

At <a href="../Poetry.html"><b>Ars Poetica</b></a>, we believe that poetry is both an art and a craft, and that there is no one way to write or read it. We celebrate the diversity and richness of poetic traditions from different cultures, languages, and periods. We also encourage experimentation and innovation, as well as critical reflection and dialogue. We hope that our website will be a place where you can discover new poems, learn new techniques, and join a community of passionate poetry lovers.

<h6>About AI and Poetry</h6>
				<p15>
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines and systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing images, solving problems, and learning from data. AI has many applications in various fields, such as healthcare, education, entertainment, and business. But what about poetry?
<br><br>

Poetry is one of the oldest and most expressive forms of human communication, which uses language in creative and imaginative ways to convey emotions, thoughts, and experiences. Poetry is often considered to be a uniquely human endeavor, reflecting the complexity and diversity of human culture and creativity. However, in recent years, AI has also shown some potential in generating and analyzing poetry, challenging the boundaries between human and machine creativity.
<br><br>

AI can generate poetry by using different techniques, such as rule-based systems, statistical models, neural networks, and evolutionary algorithms. These techniques can either mimic the style and structure of existing poems or create new poems from scratch based on user inputs or random seeds. 
<br><br>

AI can also analyze poetry by using natural language processing (NLP), which is a subfield of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. NLP can help computers understand, interpret, and manipulate natural language texts, such as poems.
<br><br>

The website name <a href="../Poetry.html"><b>"Ars Poetica"</b></a> was also inspired by AI. We used a tool called Name Generator, which uses AI to create catchy and memorable names based on keywords or categories. We entered the keyword "poetry" and selected the category "art". The tool generated several names for us to choose from, such as "Poetica", "Verse Art", "Poemify", or "Artistry". We liked the name "Ars Poetica" because it sounded elegant and classical, and it also had a connection to the history and theory of poetry.
<br><br>

We hope that our website will be a place where you can learn more about the fascinating interplay between AI and poetry, and how they can enrich each other in surprising and delightful ways.
