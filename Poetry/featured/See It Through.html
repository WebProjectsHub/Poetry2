When you’re up against a trouble,		<br>
&emsp;	Meet it squarely, face to face;		<br>
Lift your chin and set your shoulders,		<br>
&emsp;	Plant your feet and take a brace.	<br>
When it’s vain to try to dodge it,		<br>
&emsp;	Do the best that you can do;		<br>
You may fail, but you may conquer,		<br>
&emsp;	See it through!				<br><br>

Black may be the clouds about you		<br>
&emsp;	And your future may seem grim,		<br>
But don’t let your nerve desert you;		<br>
&emsp;	Keep yourself in fighting trim.		<br>
If the worst is bound to happen,		<br>
&emsp;	Spite of all that you can do,		<br>
Running from it will not save you,		<br>
&emsp;	See it through!				<br><br>

Even hope may seem but futile,			<br>
&emsp;	When with troubles you’re beset,	<br>
But remember you are facing			<br>
&emsp;	Just what other men have met.		<br>
You may fail, but fall still fighting;		<br>
&emsp;	Don’t give up, whate’er you do;		<br>
Eyes front, head high to the finish.		<br>
&emsp;	See it through!				<br>
