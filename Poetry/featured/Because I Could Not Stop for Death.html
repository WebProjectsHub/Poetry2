Because I could not stop for Death –			<br>
He kindly stopped for me –				<br>
The Carriage held but just Ourselves –			<br>
And Immortality.					<br><br>

We slowly drove – He knew no haste			<br>
And I had put away					<br>
My labor and my leisure too,				<br>
For His Civility –					<br><br>

We passed the School, where Children strove		<br>
At Recess – in the Ring –				<br>
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –			<br>
We passed the Setting Sun –				<br><br>

Or rather – He passed Us –				<br>
The Dews drew quivering and Chill –			<br>
For only Gossamer, my Gown –				<br>
My Tippet – only Tulle –				<br><br>

We paused before a House that seemed			<br>
A Swelling of the Ground –				<br>
The Roof was scarcely visible –				<br>
The Cornice – in the Ground –				<br><br>

Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet			<br>
Feels shorter than the Day				<br>
I first surmised the Horses' Heads			<br>
Were toward Eternity –					<br>
