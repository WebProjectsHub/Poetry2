As I walk through life,			<br>
I look at all I have done.		<br>
I had wandered aimlessly		<br>
And wondered what I have become.	<br><br>
	
I have been through so much.		<br>
It is amazing I made it through.	<br>
Lessons I have learned.			<br>
I am shocked I pulled through.		<br><br>

At times I wondered			<br>
What life was all about.		<br>
The trials experienced in life		<br>
Can make all the good come out.		<br><br>

We try to make it day by day,		<br>
Remembering what we were taught.	<br>
Just remember some time to pray.	<br>
It is important;			<br>
We need it every day.			<br><br>

Life can be short,			<br>
Unexpected at that.			<br>
We try to take its punches,		<br>
Just hoping it won't break our back.	<br><br>

Remember who you are,			<br>
Who you want to become.			<br>
Everything will fall into place		<br>
When the time comes.			<br><br>

Don't forget I love you's		<br>
Every chance you get.			<br>
The time may be short.			<br>
There is no time to regret.		<br><br>

Life can be exciting,			<br>
As we all have found out,		<br>
Eventful, even busy.			<br>
There is no time to be left out.	<br><br>

Remember who you are			<br>
And who you want to become.		<br>
The time can be short.			<br>
Don't leave things undone.		<br><br>

Remember your families,			<br>
They are the only ones you've got	<br>
To carry you in times of need.		<br>
They cannot be bought.			<br><br>

Remember they love you,			<br>
Either here or there.			<br>
They will always be with us,		<br>
Help for things to bear.		<br><br>
