Driver drive faster and make a good run				<br>	
Down the Springfield Line under the shining sun.		<br><br>

Fly like an aeroplane, don’t pull up short			<br>
Till you brake for Grand Central Station, New York.		<br><br>

For there in the middle of the waiting-hall			<br>
Should be standing the one that I love best of all.		<br><br>

If he’s not there to meet me when I get to town			<br>
I’ll stand on the side-walk with tears rolling down.		<br><br>

For he is the one that I love to look on,			<br>
The acme of kindness and perfection.				<br><br>

He presses my hand and he says he loves me,			<br>
Which I find a admirable peculiarity.				<br><br>

The woods are bright green on both sides of the line,		<br>
The trees have their loves though they’re different from mine.	<br><br>

But the poor fat old banker in the sun-parlour car		<br>
Has no one to love him except his cigar.			<br><br>

If I were the Head of the Church or the State,			<br>
I’d powder my nose and just tell them to wait.			<br><br>

For love’s more important and powerful than			<br>
Ever a priest or a politician.					<br>
