<hp5>
When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,		<br>
When the road you’re trudging seems all up hill,	<br>
When the funds are low and the debts are high,		<br>
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,		<br>
When care is pressing you down a bit,			<br>
Rest if you must—but don’t you quit.			<br><br>

Life is queer with its twists and turns,		<br>
As every one of us sometimes learns,			<br>
And many a failure turns about				<br>
When he might have won had he stuck it out;		<br>
Don’t give up, though the pace seems slow—		<br>
You may succeed with another blow.			<br><br>

Often the goal is nearer than				<br>
It seems to a faint and faltering man,			<br>
Often the struggler has given up			<br>
When he might have captured the victor’s cup,		<br>
And he learned too late, when the night slipped down,	<br>
How close he was to the golden crown.			<br><br>

Success is failure turned inside out—			<br>
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,			<br>
And you never can tell how close you are,		<br>
It may be near when it seems afar;			<br>
So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit—		<br>
It’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.	<br>
