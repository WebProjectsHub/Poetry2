You were born with potential.			<br>
You were born with goodness and trust.		<br>
You were born with ideals and dreams.		<br>
You were born with greatness.			<br>
You were born with wings.			<br><br>

You are not meant for crawling, so donâ€™t.	<br>
You have wings. Learn to use them, and fly.	<br><br>
