<hp5>
I do not love you except because I love you;				<br>
I go from loving to not loving you,					<br>
From waiting to not waiting for you					<br>
My heart moves from cold to fire.					<br><br>

I love you only because it's you the one I love;			<br>
I hate you deeply, and hating you					<br>
Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you		<br>
Is that I do not see you but love you blindly.				<br><br>

Maybe January light will consume					<br>
My heart with its cruel							<br>
Ray, stealing my key to true calm.					<br><br>

In this part of the story I am the one who				<br>
Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,		<br>
Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood.				<br>
