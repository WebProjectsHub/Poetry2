<hp5>
The railroad track is miles away,			<br>
And the day is loud with voices speaking,		<br>
Yet there isn't a train goes by all day			<br>
But I hear its whistle shrieking.			<br><br>

All night there isn't a train goes by,			<br>
Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming,	<br>
But I see its cinders red on the sky,			<br>
And hear its engine steaming.				<br><br>

My heart is warm with the friends I make,		<br>
And better friends I'll not be knowing;			<br>
Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,		<br>
No matter where it's going.				<br><br>
