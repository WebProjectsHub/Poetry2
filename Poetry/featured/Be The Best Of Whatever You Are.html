If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill,		<br>
&emsp;   Be a scrub in the valley — but be		<br>
The best little scrub by the side of the rill;		<br>
&emsp;   Be a bush if you can't be a tree.		<br><br>

If you can't be a bush be a bit of the grass,		<br>
&emsp;   And some highway happier make;			<br>
If you can't be a muskie then just be a bass —		<br>
&emsp;   But the liveliest bass in the lake!		<br><br>

We can't all be captains, we've got to be crew,		<br>
&emsp;   There's something for all of us here,		<br>
There's big work to do, and there's lesser to do,	<br>
&emsp;   And the task you must do is the near.		<br><br>

If you can't be a highway then just be a trail,		<br>
&emsp;   If you can't be the sun be a star;		<br>
It isn't by size that you win or you fail —		<br>
&emsp;   Be the best of whatever you are!		<br>
