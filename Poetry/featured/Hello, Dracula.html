<hp5>
If you let me inside you					<br>
I will stay by your side forever				<br>
And with the face of a child or an old man			<br>
I will give you all my love.					<br>
From beginning to end,						<br>
Even though all the rooms in the world are filled with sunshine,	<br>
The fact that you're alive, how beautiful to know		<br>
That I'm the only one who knows it.				<br>
It's okay if you don't abandon the boy in you and		<br>
It's okay if I don't desert the girl in me.			<br>
Even though all the rooms in the world are full of wide open doors,	<br>
The fact you're in agony, how beautiful to know			<br>
That I'm the only one who knows it.				<br><br>

If you give me permission					<br>
To become a white bride or virgin lunatic,			<br>
I will be the evidence						<br>
That you are you.						<br>
In the gushing darkness,					<br>
Rather than birthing a baby,					<br>
We will give birth to ourselves.				<br>
The we that we will make					<br>
Will really live.						<br>
But only if you say hey						<br>
In a voice that’s never been used in the world,			<br>
Only if my ears don’t go deaf					<br>
In the sunlight that brightens this world.			<br>
