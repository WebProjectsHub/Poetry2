Oft, in the silence of the night,	<br>
When the lonely moon rides high,	<br>
When wintry winds are whistling,	<br>
And we hear the owl's shrill cry,	<br>
In the quiet, dusky chamber,		<br>
By the flickering firelight,		<br>
Rising up between two sleepers,		<br>
Comes a spirit all in white.		<br><br>

A winsome little ghost it is,		<br>
Rosy-cheeked, and bright of eye;	<br>
With yellow curls all breaking loose	<br>
From the small cap pushed awry.		<br>
Up it climbs among the pillows,		<br>
For the "big dark" brings no dread,	<br>
And a baby's boundless fancy		<br>
Makes a kingdom of a bed.		<br><br>

A fearless little ghost it is;		<br>
Safe the night seems as the day;	<br>
The moon is but a gentle face,		<br>
And the sighing winds are gay.		<br>
The solitude is full of friends,	<br>
And the hour brings no regrets;		<br>
For, in this happy little soul,		<br>
Shines a sun that never sets.		<br><br>

A merry little ghost it is,		<br>
Dancing gayly by itself,		<br>
On the flowery counterpane,		<br>
Like a tricksy household elf;		<br>
Nodding to the fitful shadows,		<br>
As they flicker on the wall;		<br>
Talking to familiar pictures,		<br>
Mimicking the owl's shrill call.	<br><br>

A thoughtful little ghost it is;	<br>
And, when lonely gambols tire,		<br>
With chubby hands on chubby knees,	<br>
It sits winking at the fire.		<br>
Fancies innocent and lovely		<br>
Shine before those baby-eyes, —		<br>
Endless fields of dandelions,		<br>
Brooks, and birds, and butterflies.	<br><br>

A loving little ghost it is:		<br>
When crept into its nest,		<br>
Its hand on father's shoulder laid,	<br>
Its head on mother's breast,		<br>
It watches each familiar face,		<br>
With a tranquil, trusting eye;		<br>
And, like a sleepy little bird,		<br>
Sings its own soft lullaby.		<br><br>

Then those who feigned to sleep before,	<br>
Lest baby play till dawn,		<br>
Wake and watch their folded flower —	<br>
Little rose without a thorn.		<br>
And, in the silence of the night,	<br>
The hearts that love it most		<br>
Pray tenderly above its sleep,		<br>
"God bless our little ghost!"		<br><br>
