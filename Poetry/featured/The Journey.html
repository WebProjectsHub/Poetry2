One day you finally knew		<br>
what you had to do, and began,		<br>
though the voices around you		<br>
kept shouting				<br>
their bad advice—			<br>
though the whole house			<br>
began to tremble			<br>
and you felt the old tug		<br>
at your ankles.				<br>
"Mend my life!"				<br>
each voice cried.			<br>
But you didn't stop.			<br>
You knew what you had to do,		<br>
though the wind pried			<br>
with its stiff fingers			<br>
at the very foundations,		<br>
though their melancholy			<br>
was terrible.				<br>
It was already late			<br>
enough, and a wild night,		<br>
and the road full of fallen		<br>
branches and stones.			<br>
But little by little,			<br>
as you left their voices behind,	<br>
the stars began to burn			<br>
through the sheets of clouds,		<br>
and there was a new voice		<br>
which you slowly			<br>
recognized as your own,			<br>
that kept you company			<br>
as you strode deeper and deeper		<br>
into the world,				<br>
determined to do			<br>
the only thing you could do—		<br>
determined to save			<br>
the only life you could save.		<br>
