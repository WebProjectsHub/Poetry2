<hp5>
My heart is like a singing bird			<br>
Whose nest is in a waterâ€™d shoot;		<br>
My heart is like an apple-tree			<br>
Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;	<br>
My heart is like a rainbow shell		<br>
That paddles in a halcyon sea;			<br>
My heart is gladder than all these		<br>
Because my love is come to me.			<br><br>

Raise me a dais of silk and down;		<br>
Hang it with vair and purple dyes;		<br>
Carve it in doves and pomegranates,		<br>
And peacocks with a hundred eyes;		<br>
Work it in gold and silver grapes,		<br>
In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;		<br>
Because the birthday of my life			<br>
Is come, my love is come to me.			<br><br>
