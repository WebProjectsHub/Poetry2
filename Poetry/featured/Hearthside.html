Half across the world from me		<br>
Lie the lands I'll never see—		<br>
I, whose longing lives and dies		<br>
Where a ship has sailed away;		<br>
I, that never close my eyes		<br>
But to look upon Cathay.		<br><br>

Things I may not know nor tell		<br>
Wait, where older waters swell;		<br>
Ways that flowered at Sappho’s tread,	<br>
Winds that sighed in Homer’s strings,	<br>
Vibrant with the singing dead,		<br>
Golden with the dust of wings.		<br><br>

Under deeper skies than mine,		<br>
Quiet valleys dip and shine.		<br>
Where their tender grasses heal		<br>
Ancient scars of trench and tomb	<br>
I shall never walk: nor kneel		<br>
Where the bones of poets bloom.		<br><br>

If I seek a lovelier part,		<br>
Where I travel goes my heart;		<br>
Where I stray my thought must go;	<br>
With me wanders my desire.		<br>
Best to sit and watch the snow,		<br>
Turn the lock, and poke the fire.	<br><br>
