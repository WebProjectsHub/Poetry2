I'm giving you to the winds, to the earth, to the fire, to the water.	<br>
I'm giving you to the world, to the future, to the past.		<br>
I'm giving you to sorrow, to the tears, to the laughter.		<br>
I'm giving you to the stars, to the moon, to the sun at last.		<br><br>

I'm giving you to the seasons, to the days, to the hours.		<br>
I'm giving you to the silence, to the music, to the song.		<br>
I'm giving you to the questions, to the answers, to the mysteries.	<br>
I'm giving you to the right, to the wrong.				<br><br>

I'm giving you to the love, to the pain, to the passion.		<br>
I'm giving you to the joy, to the struggle, to the grace.		<br>
I'm giving you to the courage, to the fear, to the longing.		<br>
I'm giving you to the journey, to the endless space.			<br><br>

I'm giving you to the whispers, to the dreams, to the memories.		<br>
I'm giving you to the moments, to the magic, to the chance.		<br>
I'm giving you to the hope, to the faith, to the wonder.		<br>
I'm giving you to life, to love, to the dance.				<br><br>

And in the giving, I find myself, too.					<br>
For you are my heart, my soul, my everything.				<br>
And as you spread your wings and take flight,				<br>
Know that you are loved, eternally, unconditionally.			<br><br>

To my daughter, with love.						<br><br>
