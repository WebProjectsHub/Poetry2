If you could see what I see when I look at you,				<br>
You'd definitely love you, too.						<br>
You would hold your head up high,					<br>
For you possess beauty that no one can deny.				<br><br>

If you could see what I see when I look at you,				<br>
There's no way you'd be so down and blue.				<br>
You wouldn't be able to contain your smiles,				<br>
For your charm goes on for miles and miles.				<br><br>

If you could see what I see when I look at you,				<br>
You'd know there's nothing you can't do.				<br>
You'd do things without fear you'll fail,				<br>
For you've got many talents yet to unveil.				<br><br>

Please try to see what I see when I look at you.			<br>
You will feel refreshed and new.					<br>
All the anger, shame, and insecurities will just go.			<br>
I promise BABY GIRL, you are too good to ever hang your head low.	<br>
