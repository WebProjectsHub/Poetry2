Sleet fell on the waters of Haecheon’s rice paddy.	<br>
The last time they spent together as lovers		<br>
Melted away completely, like a lie.			<br>
She thought of him whom she left in the meadow.		<br>
“How much longer must I wander along the edges of pain	<br>
To erase all the memories?”				<br><br>

If memories of love were sleet				<br>
Or a snowman lost in the wrong season,			<br>
The regrets are needless.				<br>
I just wanted them gone.				<br><br>

Only disillusionment is left in the lonely meadow.	<br>
An old love crosses the river of oblivion.		<br> 
If only I could also cross this field of futility.	<br>
