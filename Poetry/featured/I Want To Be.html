I want to be your favorite hello,					<br>
And I want to be your hardest goodbye.					<br>
I want to be the one who never makes you cry,				<br>
The one who puts that sparkle in your eye.				<br><br>

I want to be the one you trust,						<br>
And I want to be the one you can tell all your secrets to.		<br>
I want to be the one always by your side,				<br>
The one you're stuck to like glue.					<br><br>

I want to be the one who makes you happy,				<br>
And I want to be the one who makes you smile.				<br>
I want to be the one waiting for you as you're walking down the aisle,	<br>
The one to whom you'd say, "For you, I'd walk a thousand miles."	<br><br>

I want to be the one you truly love,					<br>
And I want to be the one who fills your heart.				<br>
I want to be the one who's always there to hold you in the dark,	<br>
The one who loved you from the very start.				<br><br>
