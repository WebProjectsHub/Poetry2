Courage isn't a brilliant dash,				<br>
A daring deed in a moment's flash;			<br>
It isn't an instantaneous thing				<br>
Born of despair with a sudden spring			<br>
It isn't a creature of flickered hope			<br>
Or the final tug at a slipping rope;			<br>
But it's something deep in the soul of man		<br>
That is working always to serve some plan.		<br><br>

Courage isn't the last resort				<br>
In the work of life or the game of sport;		<br>
It isn't a thing that a man can call			<br>
At some future time when he's apt to fall;		<br>
If he hasn't it now, he will have it not		<br>
When the strain is great and the pace is hot.		<br>
For who would strive for a distant goal			<br>
Must always have courage within his soul.		<br><br>

Courage isn't a dazzling light				<br>
That flashes and passes away from sight;		<br>
It's a slow, unwavering, ingrained trait		<br>
With the patience to work and the strength to wait.	<br>
It's part of a man when his skies are blue,		<br>
It's part of him when he has work to do.		<br>
The brave man never is freed of it.			<br>
He has it when there is no need of it.			<br><br>

Courage was never designed for show;			<br>
It isn't a thing that can come and go;			<br>
It's written in victory and defeat			<br>
And every trial a man may meet.				<br>
It's part of his hours, his days and his years,		<br>
Back of his smiles and behind his tears.		<br>
Courage is more than a daring deed:			<br>
It's the breath of life and a strong man's creed.	<br>
