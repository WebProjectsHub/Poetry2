I will lend you, for a little time,		<br>
A child of mine, He said.			<br>
For you to love the while she lives,		<br>
And mourn for when she's dead.			<br>
It may be six or seven years,			<br>
Or twenty-two or three.				<br>
But will you, till I call her back,		<br>
Take care of her for Me?			<br>
She'll bring her charms to gladden you,		<br>
And should her stay be brief.			<br>
You'll have her lovely memories,		<br>
As solace for your grief.			<br>
I cannot promise she will stay,			<br>
Since all from earth return.			<br>
But there are lessons taught down there,	<br>
I want this child to learn.			<br>
I've looked the wide world over,		<br>
In search for teachers true.			<br>
And from the throngs that crowd life's lanes,	<br>
I have selected you.				<br>
Now will you give her all your love,		<br>
Nor think the labour vain.			<br>
Nor hate me when I come				<br>
To take her home again?				<br>
I fancied that I heard them say,		<br>
'Dear Lord, Thy will be done!'			<br>
For all the joys Thy child shall bring,		<br>
The risk of grief we'll run.			<br>
We'll shelter her with tenderness,		<br>
We'll love her while we may,			<br>
And for the happiness we've known,		<br>
Forever grateful stay.				<br>
But should the angels call for her,		<br>
Much sooner than we've planned.			<br>
We'll brave the bitter grief that comes,	<br>
And try to understand.				<br><br>
