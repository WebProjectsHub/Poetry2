You start dying slowly				<br>
if you do not travel,				<br>
if you do not read,				<br>
If you do not listen to the sounds of life,	<br>
If you do not appreciate yourself.		<br><br>

You start dying slowly				<br>
When you kill your self-esteem;			<br>
When you do not let others help you.		<br><br>

You start dying slowly				<br>
If you become a slave of your habits,		<br>
Walking everyday on the same paths…		<br>
If you do not change your routine,		<br>
If you do not wear different colours		<br>
Or you do not speak to those you don’t know.	<br><br>

You start dying slowly				<br>
If you avoid to feel passion			<br>
And their turbulent emotions;			<br>
Those which make your eyes glisten		<br>
And your heart beat fast.			<br><br>

You start dying slowly				<br>
If you do not change your life when you are not satisfied with your job, or with your love,	<br>
If you do not risk what is safe for the uncertain,						<br>
If you do not go after a dream,			<br>
If you do not allow yourself,			<br>
At least once in your lifetime,			<br>
To run away from sensible advice.		<br><br>
