Later today, when the shadows come		<br>
Talk to me, though I have gone			<br><br>

Write notes and letters if you must		<br>
Share your fears, your hopes, your trust	<br><br>

Keep those photos of me on the wall		<br>
And ask for help when trouble calls		<br><br>

Keep up with nothings, keep up with friends	<br>
Finish the unfinished; tie up loose ends	<br><br>

Still, remember me on special days		<br>
Yet don't forget my mundane ways		<br><br>

Devour those things we used to share		<br>
Take time for yourself, though I'm not there	<br><br>

Will you take me with you, near and far		<br>
And keep me proud of who you are		<br><br>

And when trials and triumphs come your way	<br>
Remember me, later today 			<br>
