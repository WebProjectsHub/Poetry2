Let her remember,				<br>
That I loved her the best,			<br>
More than anyone, or anything,			<br>
And more than all the rest.			<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
That I loved to sing,				<br>
Loud and clear, with no fear,			<br>
As fresh as the day could bring.		<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
I wore my heart on my sleeve,			<br>
That I took a million photos,			<br>
Knowing one day, I’d have to leave.		<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
I loved the morning sun,			<br>
That sunsets could take my breath away,		<br>
And make me feel I’d won.			<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
I treasured our time together,			<br>
That by her side, and hand in hand,		<br>
I could live forever.				<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
My joy to hear her read,			<br>
So young, so fresh so smart,			<br>
My time was all she’d need.			<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
My hopes for her were vast,			<br>
And only got much stronger,			<br>
As she grew up so fast.				<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
The pride I felt in me,				<br>
That I was her mother,				<br>
And she was mine to see.			<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
That she completed me,				<br>
That every day together,			<br>
I felt I was free.				<br><br>

Let her remember,				<br>
We’d always be together,			<br>
Because inside her heart,			<br>
I would live forever.				<br><br>
