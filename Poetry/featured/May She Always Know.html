I want my daughter			<br>
to know her own strength,		<br>
to know love without borders,		<br>
and dream at great length.		<br><br>

I hope she is brave,			<br>
and I hope she reads books,		<br>
when people say she’s pretty -		<br>
she’ll know it’s more than her looks.	<br><br>

For she’s pretty smart,			<br>
and she’s pretty kind.			<br>
May she be heard for her voice,		<br>
and seen for her mind.			<br><br>

As she grows into a woman		<br>
I hope she stands strong.		<br>
For some will try to knock her,		<br>
but I hope she holds on.		<br><br>

Because her power is great,		<br>
and cannot be measured.			<br>
Her passion and vulnerability		<br>
should always be treasured.		<br><br>

May she know the difference		<br>
between right and wrong,		<br>
not because of some rules,		<br>
but what is in her heart’s song.	<br><br>

May she question the narrative,		<br>
make choices, speak clear.		<br>
May she never repeat herself		<br>
out of doubt or fear.			<br><br>

May she strive for big things			<br>
in a world that screams thin,			<br>
just as a man’s size does not define him.	<br><br>

I hope she sticks up for those who need it,	<br>
herself included, I hope she believes it.	<br><br>

May no one dim her light,			<br>
May it shine					<br>
May it grow					<br>
What a force that she is.			<br><br>

May she always know.				<br><br>
