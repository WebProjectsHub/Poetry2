Whose woods these are I think I know. 	<br>  
His house is in the village though;  	<br> 
He will not see me stopping here 	<br>  
To watch his woods fill up with snow.	<br><br>

My little horse must think it queer  	<br> 
To stop without a farmhouse near 	<br>  
Between the woods and frozen lake  	<br> 
The darkest evening of the year.  	<br><br> 

He gives his harness bells a shake  	<br> 
To ask if there is some mistake.  	<br> 
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep  	<br> 
Of easy wind and downy flake.   	<br><br>

The woods are lovely, dark and deep, 	<br>  
But I have promises to keep,   		<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,  	<br> 
And miles to go before I sleep.		<br>
