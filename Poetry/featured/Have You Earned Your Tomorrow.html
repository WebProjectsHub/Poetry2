Is anybody happier because you passed his way?					<br>
&emsp;     Does anyone remember that you spoke to him today?			<br>
This day is almost over, and its toiling time is through;			<br>
&emsp;     Is there anyone to utter now a kindly word of you?			<br><br>

Did you give a cheerful greeting to the friend who came along?			<br>
&emsp;   Or a churlish sort of "Howdy" and then vanish in the throng?		<br>
Were you selfish pure and simple as you rushed along the way,			<br>
&emsp;   Or is someone mighty grateful for a deed you did today?		<br><br>

Can you say tonight, in parting with the day that's slipping fast,		<br>
&emsp;     That you helped a single brother of the many that you passed?	<br>
Is a single heart rejoicing over what you did or said;				<br>
&emsp;     Does a man whose hopes were fading now with courage look ahead?	<br><br>

Did you waste the day, or lose it, was it well or sorely spent?			<br>
&emsp;     Did you leave a trail of kindness or a scar of discontent?		<br>
As you close your eyes in slumber do you think that God would say,		<br>
&emsp;     You have earned one more tomorrow by the work you did today?	<br>
