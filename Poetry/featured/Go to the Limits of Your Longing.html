<hp5>
God speaks to each of us as he makes us,	<br>
then walks with us silently out of the night.	<br>
These are the words we dimly hear:		<br><br>

You, sent out beyond your recall,		<br>
go to the limits of your longing.		<br>
Embody me.					<br><br>

Flare up like a flame				<br>
and make big shadows I can move in.		<br><br>

Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.<br>
Just keep going. No feeling is final.		<br>
Donâ€™t let yourself lose me.			<br><br>

Nearby is the country they call life.		<br>
You will know it by its seriousness.		<br><br>

Give me your hand.				<br><br>
