You're not your age,				<br>
Nor the size you wear.				<br>
You're not your weight,				<br>
Or the color of your hair.			<br>
You're not your name,				<br>
Or the dimples on your cheeks.			<br>
You are all the books you read,			<br>
And all the words you speak.			<br>
You are your croaky morning voice,		<br>
And the smiles you try to hide.			<br>
You are the sweetness in your laughter		<br>
And every tear you've cried.			<br>
You are the songs you sing so loudly		<br>
When you know you're all alone.			<br>
You are the places that you've been to,		<br>
And the ones that you call home.		<br>
You are the thing that you believe in.		<br>
You are the photos in your bedroom		<br>
And the future you dream of.			<br>
You are made up of so much beauty.		<br>
But it seems that you forgot			<br>
When you decided that you are defined,		<br>
By all the things you are not.			<br>
