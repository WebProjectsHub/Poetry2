You took away my innocence			<br>
My hopes, my dreams, my youth			<br>
You took from me my very soul			<br>
What could have been, I never knew		<br><br>

Your words would cut me deep inside		<br>
Deep to the very core				<br>
Darkness. Cold. I could not feel		<br>
Why did you hate me so?				<br><br>

... You crushed me as I screamed in pain	<br>
Your words ripped out my heart			<br>
The world grew dull. I felt insane		<br>
Did you ever care about that part?		<br><br>

Is that what you wanted all along?		<br>
"I win!" "You lose!" A game?			<br>
Control, submission, guilt, defeat		<br>
Yet, I still remain				<br><br>

It was for a child that I lived			<br>
Although I rather would have died		<br>
Now, how I thank God for that child!		<br>
Because of her, I have survived			<br><br>

I will live in spite of you			<br>
You no longer have a say			<br>
My Life, my Body, my Mind, my Soul		<br>
You will never again have control		<br><br>

Whether in this world or in the next		<br>
Justice will have a way				<br>
You hurt me and you almost won			<br>
But "You Lost!", I have to say			<br><br>

A new Dawn breaks of Hope and Peace		<br>
Of Happiness and Grace				<br>
From me, these things YOU CANNOT TAKE		<br>
My head held high, I walk by Faith.		<br>
