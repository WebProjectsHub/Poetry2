When you get what you want in your struggle for pelf,		<br>
And the world makes you King for a day,				<br>
Then go to the mirror and look at yourself,			<br>
And see what that guy has to say.				<br><br>

For it isn’t your Father, or Mother, or Wife,			<br>
Who judgement upon you must pass.				<br>
The feller whose verdict counts most in your life		<br>
Is the guy staring back from the glass.				<br><br>

He’s the feller to please, never mind all the rest,		<br>
For he’s with you clear up to the end,				<br>
And you’ve passed your most dangerous, difficult test		<br>
If the guy in the glass is your friend.				<br><br>

You may be like Jack Horner and “chisel” a plum,		<br>
And think you’re a wonderful guy,				<br>
But the man in the glass says you’re only a bum			<br>
If you can’t look him straight in the eye.			<br><br>

You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years,		<br>
And get pats on the back as you pass,				<br>
But your final reward will be heartaches and tears		<br>
If you’ve cheated the guy in the glass.				<br><br>
