I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;		<br>
I lift my lids and all is born again.			<br>
(I think I made you up inside my head.)			<br><br>

The stars go waltzing out in blue and red,		<br>
And arbitrary blackness gallops in:			<br>
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.		<br><br>

I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed		<br>
And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.	<br>
(I think I made you up inside my head.)			<br><br>

God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:		<br>
Exit seraphim and Satan's men:				<br>
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.		<br><br>

I fancied you'd return the way you said,		<br>
But I grow old and I forget your name.			<br>
(I think I made you up inside my head.)			<br><br>

I should have loved a thunderbird instead;		<br>
At least when spring comes they roar back again.	<br>
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.		<br>
(I think I made you up inside my head.)			<br>
