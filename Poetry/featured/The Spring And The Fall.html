In the spring of the year, in the spring of the year,	<br>
I walked the road beside my dear.			<br>
The trees were black where the bark was wet.		<br>
I see them yet, in the spring of the year.		<br>
He broke me a bough of the blossoming peach		<br>
That was out of the way and hard to reach.		<br><br>

In the fall of the year, in the fall of the year,	<br>
I walked the road beside my dear.			<br>
The rooks went up with a raucous trill.			<br>
I hear them still, in the fall of the year.		<br>
He laughed at all I dared to praise,			<br>
And broke my heart, in little ways.			<br><br>

Year be springing or year be falling,			<br>
The bark will drip and the birds be calling.		<br>
There's much that's fine to see and hear		<br>
In the spring of a year, in the fall of a year.		<br>
'Tis not love's going hurt my days.			<br>
But that it went in little ways.			<br>
