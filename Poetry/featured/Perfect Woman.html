She was a phantom of delight			<br>
When first she gleam'd upon my sight;		<br>
A lovely apparition, sent			<br>
To be a moment's ornament;			<br>
Her eyes as stars of twilight fair;		<br>
Like twilight's, too, her dusky hair;		<br>
But all things else about her drawn		<br>
From May-time and the cheerful dawn;		<br>
A dancing shape, an image gay,			<br>
To haunt, to startle, and waylay.		<br><br>

I saw her upon nearer view,			<br>
A Spirit, yet a Woman too!			<br>
Her household motions light and free,		<br>
And steps of virgin liberty;			<br>
A countenance in which did meet			<br>
Sweet records, promises as sweet;		<br>
A creature not too bright or good		<br>
For human nature's daily food;			<br>
For transient sorrows, simple wiles,		<br>
Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.	<br><br>

And now I see with eye serene			<br>
The very pulse of the machine;			<br>
A being breathing thoughtful breath,		<br>
A traveller between life and death;		<br>
The reason firm, the temperate will,		<br>
Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;	<br>
A perfect Woman, nobly plannâ€™d,			<br>
To warn, to comfort, and command;		<br>
And yet a Spirit still, and bright		<br>
With something of angelic light.		<br><br>
