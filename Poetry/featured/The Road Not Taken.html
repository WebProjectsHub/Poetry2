Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,		<br>
And sorry I could not travel both		<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood		<br>
And looked down one as far as I could		<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;		<br><br>

Then took the other, as just as fair,		<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,		<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;		<br>
Though as for that the passing there		<br>
Had worn them really about the same,		<br><br>

And both that morning equally lay		<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.		<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!		<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,		<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.		<br><br>

I shall be telling this with a sigh		<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:			<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”		<br>
I took the one less traveled by,		<br>
And that has made all the difference.		<br>
