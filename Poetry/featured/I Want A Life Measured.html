<hp5>
I want a life measured			<br>
in first steps on foreign soils		<br>
and deep breaths			<br>
in brand new seas.			<br>
I want a life measured			<br>
in Welcome Signs,			<br>
each stamped				<br>
with a different name,			<br>
borders marked with metal and paint.	<br>
Show me the streets			<br>
that don’t know the music		<br>
of my meandering feet,			<br>
and I will play their song		<br>
upon them.				<br>
Perfume me please			<br>
in the smells of far away,		<br>
I will never wash my hair		<br>
if it promises to stay.			<br>
I want a life measured			<br>
in the places I haven’t gone,		<br>
short sleeps on long flights,		<br>
strange voices teaching me		<br>
new words to				<br>
describe the dawn.			<br><br>
