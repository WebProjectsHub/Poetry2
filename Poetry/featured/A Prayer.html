<hp5>
God grant me kindly thought			<br>
And patience through the day,			<br>
And in the things I've wrought			<br>
Let no man living say				<br>
That hate's grim mark has stained		<br>
What little joy I've gained.			<br><br>

God keep my nature sweet,			<br>
Teach me to bear a blow,			<br>
Disaster and defeat,				<br>
And no resentment show.				<br>
If failure must be mine				<br>
Sustain this soul of mine.			<br><br>

God grant me strength to face			<br>
Undaunted day or night;				<br>
To stoop to no disgrace				<br>
To win my little fight;				<br>
Let me be, when it is o'er,			<br>
As manly as before.				<br>
