I think that I shall never see			<br>
A poem lovely as a tree.			<br><br>

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest		<br>
Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;	<br><br>

A tree that looks at God all day,		<br>
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;		<br><br>

A tree that may in Summer wear			<br>
A nest of robins in her hair;			<br><br>

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;			<br>
Who intimately lives with rain.			<br><br>

Poems are made by fools like me,		<br>
But only God can make a tree.			<br><br>
