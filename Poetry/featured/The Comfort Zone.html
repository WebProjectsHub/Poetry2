I used to have a comfort zone where I knew I couldn't fail.		<br>
The same four walls and busy work were really more like jail.		<br>
I longed for so much to do the things I'd never done before,		<br>
But I stayed inside my comfort zone and paced the same old floor.	<br><br>

I said it didn't matter that I wasn't doing much;			<br>
I said I didn't care for diamonds, cars and such.			<br>
I claimed to be so busy with the things inside the zone,		<br>
But deep inside I longed for some small victory of my own.		<br><br>

I couldn't let my life go by just watching others win,			<br>
So I stepped outside my comfort zone to let the change begin.		<br>
I took a step and with new strength I'd never felt before,		<br>
I kissed my comfort zone goodbye, closed and locked the door.		<br><br>

If you are in your comfort zone, afraid to venture out,			<br>
Remember that all others were at one time filled with doubt.		<br>
A step or two and words of praise can make your dreams come true,	<br>
So greet your future with a smile- success is there for you!		<br><br>
