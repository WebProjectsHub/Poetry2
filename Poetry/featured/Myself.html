<hp5>
I have to live with myself and so		<br>
I want to be fit for myself to know.		<br>
I want to be able as days go by,		<br>
always to look myself straight in the eye;	<br>
I don't want to stand with the setting sun	<br>
and hate myself for the things I have done.	<br>
I don't want to keep on a closet shelf		<br>
a lot of secrets about myself			<br>
and fool myself as I come and go		<br>
into thinking no one else will ever know	<br>
the kind of person I really am,			<br>
I don't want to dress up myself in sham.	<br>
I want to go out with my head erect		<br>
I want to deserve all men's respect;		<br>
but here in the struggle for fame and wealth	<br>
I want to be able to like myself.		<br>
I don't want to look at myself and know that	<br>
I am bluster and bluff and empty show.		<br>
I never can hide myself from me;		<br>
I see what others may never see;		<br>
I know what others may never know,		<br>
I never can fool myself and so,			<br>
whatever happens I want to be			<br>
self respecting and conscience free.		<br>
