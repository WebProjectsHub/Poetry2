Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?				<br>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:			<br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,			<br>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;			<br>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,			<br>
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;			<br>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,			<br>
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;		<br>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,				<br>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;			<br>
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,		<br>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:			<br>
&emsp;&emsp;So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,		<br>
&emsp;&emsp;So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.	<br>
