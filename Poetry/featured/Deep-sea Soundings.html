MARINER, what of the deep?						<br>
&emsp;	This of the deep:						<br>
Twilight is there, and solemn, changeless calm;				<br>
Beauty is there, and tender healing balm—				<br>
Balm with no root in earth, or air, or sea,  				<br>    
Poised by the finger of God, it floateth free,				<br>
And, as it threads the waves, the sound doth rise,—			<br>
Hither shall come no further sacrifice;					<br>
Never again the anguished clutch at life,				<br>
Never again great Love and Death in strife;				<br>      
He who hath suffered all, need fear no more,				<br>
Quiet his portion now, for evermore.					<br><br>

Mariner, what of the deep?						<br>
&emsp;	This of the deep:						<br>
Solitude dwells not there, though silence reign;			<br>      
Mighty the brotherhood of loss and pain;				<br>
There is communion past the need of speech,				<br>
There is a love no words of love can reach;				<br>
Heavy the waves that superincumbent press,				<br>
But as we labour here with constant stress,				<br>      
Hand doth hold out to hand not help alone,				<br>
But the deep bliss of being fully known.				<br>
There are no kindred like the kin of sorrow,				<br>
There is no hope like theirs who fear no morrow.			<br><br>

Mariner, what of the deep?     						<br> 
&emsp;	This of the deep:						<br>
Though we have travelled past the line of day,				<br>
Glory of night doth light us on our way,				<br>
Radiance that comes we know not how nor whence,				<br>
Rainbows without the rain, past duller sense,				<br>      
Music of hidden reefs and waves long past,				<br>
Thunderous organ tones from far-off blast,				<br>
Harmony, victrix, throned in state sublime,				<br>
Couched on the wrecks be-gemmed with pearls of time;			<br>
Never a wreck but brings some beauty here;   				<br>   
Down where the waves are stilled the sea shines clear;			<br>
Deeper than life the plan of life doth lie,				<br>
He who knows all, fears naught. Great Death shall die.			<br>
