If you can keep your head when all about you		<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;		<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,	<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;		<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,		<br>
Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,		<br>
Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,		<br>
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;		<br><br>

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;	<br>
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;	<br>
If you can meet with triumph and disaster		<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;		<br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken		<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,		<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,	<br>
And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;		<br><br>

If you can make one heap of all your winnings		<br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,		<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings		<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;		<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew		<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,		<br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you		<br>
Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;		<br><br>

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,	<br>
Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;		<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;	<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;		<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute			<br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—		<br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,		<br>
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!		<br>
