<hp5>
Never trust a white man,			<br>
Never kill a Jew,				<br>
Never sign a contract,				<br>
Never rent a pew.				<br>
Don't enlist in armies;				<br>
Nor marry many wives;				<br>
Never write for magazines;			<br>
Never scratch your hives.			<br>
Always put paper on the seat,			<br>
Don't believe in wars,				<br>
Keep yourself both clean and neat,		<br>
Never marry whores.				<br>
Never pay a blackmailer,			<br>
Never go to law,				<br>
Never trust a publisher,			<br>
Or you'll sleep on straw.			<br>
All your friends will leave you			<br>
All your friends will die			<br>
So lead a clean and wholesome life		<br>
And join them in the sky.			<br>
