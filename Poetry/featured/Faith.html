<hp5>
This much I know:				<br>
God does not wrong us here,			<br>
Though oft His judgments seem severe		<br>
And reason falters 'neath the blow,		<br>
Some day we'll learn 'twas better so.		<br><br>

So oft I've erred				<br>
In trifling matters of my own concern;		<br>
So oft I've blundered at the simplest turn,	<br>
Chosen the false path or the foolish word	<br>
That what I call my judgment seems absurd.	<br><br>

My puny reason cries				<br>	
Against the bitter and the cruel blows,		<br>
Measuring the large world by the inch it knows,	<br>
Seeing all joy and pain through selfish eyes,	<br>
Not knowing hurt and suffering may be wise.	<br><br>

But I have come to see,				<br>
So vast God's love, so infinite His plan	<br>
That it is well it was not left to man		<br>
To alter or to say what is to be,		<br>
When reason failed, faith also then would flee.	<br><br>

God knoweth best!				<br>
Through the black night and agony of grief	<br>
Faith whispers low: "Hold fast to your belief!	<br>
In time His purpose He shall manifest,		<br>
Then shall you learn how greatly you were blest."	<br>
