<hp5>
Each lover has some theory of his own			<br>
About the difference between the ache			<br>
Of being with his love, and being alone:		<br><br>

Why what, when dreaming, is dear flesh and bone		<br>
That really stirs the senses, when awake,		<br>
Appears a simulacrum of his own.			<br><br>

Narcissus disbelieves in the unknown;			<br>
He cannot join his image in the lake			<br>
So long as he assumes he is alone.			<br><br>

The child, the waterfall, the fire, the stone,		<br>
Are always up to mischief, though, and take		<br>
The universe for granted as their own.			<br><br>

The elderly, like Proust, are always prone		<br>
To think of love as a subjective fake;			<br>
The more they love, the more they feel alone.		<br><br>

Whatever view we hold, it must be shown			<br>
Why every lover has a wish to make			<br>
Some kind of otherness his own:				<br>
Perhaps, in fact, we never are alone.			<br><br>
