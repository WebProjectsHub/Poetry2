<hp5>
Some say the world will end in fire,		<br>
Some say in ice.				<br>
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire			<br>
I hold with those who favor fire.		<br>
But if it had to perish twice,			<br>
I think I know enough of hate			<br>
To say that for destruction ice			<br>
Is also great					<br>
And would suffice.				<br>
