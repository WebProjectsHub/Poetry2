<hp5>
To live as gently as I can;			<br>
To be, no matter where, a man;			<br>
To take what comes of good or ill		<br>
And cling to faith and honor still;		<br>
To do my best, and let that stand		<br>
The record of my brain and hand;		<br>
And then, should failure come to me,		<br>
Still work and hope for victory.		<br><br>

To have no secret place wherein			<br>
I stoop unseen to shame or sin;			<br>
To be the same when I'm alone			<br>
As when my every deed is known;			<br>
To live undaunted, unafraid			<br>
Of any step that I have made;			<br>
To be without pretense or sham			<br>
Exactly what men think I am.			<br><br>

To leave some simple mark behind		<br>
To keep my having lived in mind;		<br>
If enmity to aught I show,			<br>
To be an honest, generous foe,			<br>
To play my little part, nor whine		<br>
That greater honors are not mine.		<br>
This, I believe, is all I need			<br>
For my philosophy and creed.			<br>
