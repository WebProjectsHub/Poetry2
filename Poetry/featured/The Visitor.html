A visitor comes.				<br>
It is a tremendous feat.			<br>
I open my door,					<br>
And make a hospitable place.			<br><br>

The visitor comes				<br>
With his past and present and his future.	<br>
Like the wind that broke through my window,	<br>
He comes and goes as he pleases.		<br><br>

The visitor comes				<br>
With a heart that has been broken.		<br>
Can my heart mimic that wind			<br>
And become a hospitable place?			<br>
