The summer girl			<br>
In peek-a-boos			<br>
And open hose			<br>
And narrow shoes,		<br>
Now trips along			<br>
The sandy beach,		<br>
While each man mutters:		<br>
'She's a peach.'		<br><br>

And now she meets		<br>
A handsome man,			<br>
Who kindly stoops		<br>
To get her fan;			<br>
Thus is the romance		<br>
Quickly staged,			<br>
Next day, of course,		<br>
They are engaged.		<br><br>

In two short weeks		<br>
They separate,			<br>
Back to the daily		<br>
Grind they hate;		<br>
He to his office,		<br>
She the store,			<br>
And thus their brief		<br>
Engagement's o'er.		<br><br>

He quite forgets		<br>
They ever met,			<br>
But she refuses			<br>
To forget;			<br>
She tells her friends,		<br>
With many a sigh:		<br>
'I almost had			<br>
A wealthy guy.'			<br>
