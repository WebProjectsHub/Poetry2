The years have passed by		<br>
In the blink of an eye,			<br>
Moments of sadness			<br>
And joy have flown by.			<br><br>

People I loved				<br>
Have come and have gone,		<br>
But the world never stopped,		<br>
And we all carried on.			<br><br>

Life wasn't easy,			<br>
And the struggles were there,		<br>
Filled with times that it mattered,	<br>
Times I just didn't care.		<br><br>

I stood on my own,			<br>
And I still found my way,		<br>
Through some nights filled with tears,	<br>
And the dawn of new days.		<br><br>

And now with old age,			<br>
It's become very clear;			<br>
Things I once found important		<br>
Were not why I was here.		<br><br>

And how many things			<br>
That I managed to buy			<br>
Were never what made me			<br>
Feel better inside.			<br><br>

And the worries and fears		<br>
That plagued me each day,		<br>
In the end of it all,			<br>
Would just fade away.			<br><br>

But how much I reached out		<br>
To others when needed,			<br>
Would be the true measure		<br>
Of how I succeeded.			<br><br>

And how much I shared			<br>
Of my soul and my heart			<br>
Would ultimately be			<br>
What set me apart.			<br><br>

And what's really important,		<br>
Is my opinion of me,			<br>
And whether or not			<br>
I'm the best I can be.			<br><br>

And how much more kindness		<br>
And love I can show			<br>
Before the Lord tells me		<br>
It's my time to go.			<br>
