Breathe in the fresh air,				<br>
Put your mind at ease.					<br>
Let down your hair,					<br>
Let it flow in the breeze.				<br><br>

Let your eyes wander					<br>
To all the beauty to be seen.				<br>
If those toxic thoughts you still do ponder,		<br>
Then let out a scream.					<br><br>

Scream until the pain is gone,				<br>
Until you no longer feel afraid.			<br>
Open your eyes to a new dawn,				<br>
Let the darkness fade.					<br><br>

No longer compare yourself				<br>
Or your flaws to others' perfections.			<br>
Take the negativity off the shelf.			<br>
Focus on your direction.				<br><br>

Pick the sadness up off the floor,			<br>
Sweep it into the wind.					<br>
Close the door on self-hatred.				<br>
Never let it back in.					<br><br>

For the lies it would often tell you,			<br>
You will no longer agree.				<br>
Happiness and love are what you should hold onto.	<br>
They are whom you should give the key.			<br><br>

Pay no attention to the toxic thoughts,			<br>
Listen to those who adore everything you are.		<br>
Overthinking was what you once were taught,		<br>
But now those thoughts you put in a jar.		<br><br>

Focus on your goals,					<br>
Never lose your fight.					<br>
It's time to open new scrolls.				<br>
Everything will be all right.				<br><br>
