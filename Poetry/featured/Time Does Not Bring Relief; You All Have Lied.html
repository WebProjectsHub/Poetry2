Time does not bring relief; you all have lied 		<br>  
Who told me time would ease me of my pain! 		<br>  
I miss him in the weeping of the rain; 			<br>  
I want him at the shrinking of the tide;		<br>
The old snows melt from every mountain-side,		<br>   
And last year’s leaves are smoke in every lane;		<br>   
But last year’s bitter loving must remain		<br>
Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide.		<br>   
There are a hundred places where I fear  		<br> 
To go,—so with his memory they brim.   			<br>
And entering with relief some quiet place 		<br>  
Where never fell his foot or shone his face  		<br> 
I say, “There is no memory of him here!”  		<br> 
And so stand stricken, so remembering him.		<br>
