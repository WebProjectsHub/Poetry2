I						<br>
Love me Sweet, with all thou art,		<br>
<div>&ensp;   Feeling, thinking, seeing;	<br>
Love me in the lightest part,			<br>
<div>&ensp;   Love me in full being.		<br><br>

II						<br>
Love me with thine open youth			<br>
<div>&ensp;   In its frank surrender;		<br>
With the vowing of thy mouth,			<br>
<div>&ensp;   With its silence tender.		<br><br>

III						<br>
Love me with thine azure eyes,			<br>
<div>&ensp;   Made for earnest granting;	<br>
Taking colour from the skies,			<br>
<div>&ensp;   Can Heaven’s truth be wanting?	<br><br>
	
IV						<br>
Love me with their lids, that fall		<br>
<div>&ensp;   Snow-like at first meeting;	<br>
Love me with thine heart, that all		<br>
<div>&ensp;   Neighbours then see beating.	<br><br>
	
V						<br>
Love me with thine hand stretched out		<br>
<div>&ensp;   Freely—open-minded:		<br>
Love me with thy loitering foot,—		<br>
<div>&ensp;   Hearing one behind it.		<br><br>
	
VI						<br>
Love me with thy voice, that turns		<br>
<div>&ensp;   Sudden faint above me;		<br>
Love me with thy blush that burns		<br>
<div>&ensp;   When I murmur Love me!		<br><br>
	
VII						<br>
Love me with thy thinking soul,			<br>
<div>&ensp;   Break it to love-sighing;		<br>
Love me with thy thoughts that roll		<br>
<div>&ensp;   On through living—dying.		<br><br>
	
VIII						<br>
Love me when in thy gorgeous airs,		<br>
<div>&ensp;   When the world has crowned thee;	<br>
Love me, kneeling at thy prayers,		<br>
<div>&ensp;   With the angels round thee.	<br><br>
<	
IX						<br>
Love me pure, as musers do,			<br>
<div>&ensp;   Up the woodlands shady:		<br>
Love me gaily, fast and true			<br>
<div>&ensp;   As a winsome lady.		<br><br>

X						<br>
Through all hopes that keep us brave,		<br>
<div>&ensp;   Farther off or nigher,		<br>
Love me for the house and grave,		<br>
<div>&ensp;   And for something higher.		<br><br>

XI						<br>
Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear,		<br>
<div>&ensp;   Woman’s love no fable.		<br>
I will love thee—half a year—			<br>
<div>&ensp;   As a man is able.			<br><br>
