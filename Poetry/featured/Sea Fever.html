<hp5>
I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,			<br>
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,				<br>
And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,			<br>
And a grey mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking.				<br><br>

I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide			<br>
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;					<br>
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,				<br>
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.			<br><br>

I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,				<br>
To the gull's way and the whale's way, where the wind's like a whetted knife;		<br>
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,				<br>
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.				<br>
