I am the only being whose doom			<br>
No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn;	<br>
I never caused a thought of gloom,		<br>
A smile of joy, since I was born.		<br><br>

In secret pleasure, secret tears,		<br>
This changeful life has slipped away,		<br>
As friendless after eighteen years,		<br>
As lone as on my natal day.			<br><br>

There have been times I cannot hide,		<br>
There have been times when this was drear,	<br>
When my sad soul forgot its pride		<br>
And longed for one to love me here.		<br><br>

But those were in the early glow		<br>
Of feelings since subdued by care;		<br>
And they have died so long ago,			<br>
I hardly now believe they were.			<br><br>

First melted off the hope of youth,		<br>
Then fancy’s rainbow fast withdrew;		<br>
And then experience told me truth		<br>
In mortal bosoms never grew.			<br><br>

’Twas grief enough to think mankind		<br>
All hollow, servile, insincere;			<br>
But worse to trust to my own mind		<br>
And find the same corruption there.		<br>
