Lord, make me tolerant and wise;		<br>
Incline my ears to hear him through;		<br>
Let him not stand with downcast eyes,		<br>
Fearing to trust me and be true.		<br>
Instruct me so that I may know			<br>
The way my son and I should go.			<br><br>

When he shall err, as once did I,		<br>
Or boyhood folly bids him stray,		<br>
Let me not into anger fly			<br>
And drive the good in him away.			<br>
Teach me to win his trust, that he		<br>
Shall keep no secret hid from me.		<br><br>

Lord, strengthen me that I may be .		<br>
A fit example for my son.			<br>
Grant he may never hear or see			<br>
A shameful deed that I have done.		<br>
However sorely I am tried,			<br>
Let me not undermine his pride.			<br><br>

In spite of years and temples gray,		<br>
Still let my spirit beat with joy;		<br>
Teach me to share in all his play		<br>
And be a comrade with my boy.			<br>
Wherever we may chance to be,			<br>
Let him find happiness with me.			<br><br>

Lord, as his father, now I pray			<br>
For manhood's strength and counsel wise;	<br>
Let me deal justly, day by day,			<br>
In all that fatherhood implies.			<br>
To be his father, keep me fit;			<br>
Let me not play the hypocrite!			<br>
