Oh, little girl with eyes of brown			<br>
And smiles that fairly light the town,			<br>
I wonder if you really know				<br>
Just why it is we love you so,				<br>
And why- with all the little girls			<br>
With shining eyes and tangled curls			<br>
That throng and dance this big world through-		<br>
Our hearts have room for only you.			<br><br>

Since other little girls are gay			<br>
And laugh and sing and romp in play,			<br>
And all are beautiful to see,				<br>
Why should you mean so much to me?			<br>
And why should Mother, day and night,			<br>
Make you her source of all delight,			<br>
And always find in your caress				<br>
Her greatest sum of happiness?				<br><br>

Oh, there's a reason good for this,			<br>
You laughing little bright-eyed miss!			<br>
In all this town, with all its girls			<br>
With shining eyes and sun-kissed curls,			<br>
If we should search it through and through		<br>
We'd find not one so fair as you;			<br>
And none, however fair of face,				<br>
Within our hearts could take your place.		<br><br>

For, one glad day not long ago,				<br>
God sent you down to us below,				<br>
And said that you were ours to keep,			<br>
To guard awake and watch asleep;			<br>
And ever since the day you came				<br>
No other child has seemed the same;			<br>
No other smiles are quite so fair			<br>
As those which happily you wear.			<br><br>

We seem to live from day to day				<br>
To hear the things you have to say;			<br>
And just because God gave us you,			<br>
We prize the little things you do.			<br>
Though God has filled this world with flowers,		<br>
We like you best because you're ours-			<br>
In you our greatest joys we know,			<br>
And that is why we love you so.				<br>
