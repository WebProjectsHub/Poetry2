How does Love speak?						<br>
In the faint flush upon the telltale cheek,			<br>
And in the pallor that succeeds it; by				<br>
The quivering lid of an averted eye--				<br>
The smile that proves the parent to a sigh			<br>
Thus doth Love speak.						<br><br>

How does Love speak?						<br>
By the uneven heart-throbs, and the freak			<br>
Of bounding pulses that stand still and ache,			<br>
While new emotions, like strange barges, make			<br>
Along vein-channels their disturbing course;			<br>
Still as the dawn, and with the dawn's swift force--		<br>
Thus doth Love speak.						<br><br>

How does Love speak?						<br>
In the avoidance of that which we seek--			<br>
The sudden silence and reserve when near--			<br>
The eye that glistens with an unshed tear--			<br>
The joy that seems the counterpart of fear,			<br>
As the alarmed heart leaps in the breast,			<br>
And knows, and names, and greets its godlike guest--		<br>
Thus doth Love speak.						<br><br>

How does Love speak?						<br>
In the proud spirit suddenly grown meek--			<br>
The haughty heart grown humble; in the tender			<br>
And unnamed light that floods the world with splendor;		<br>
In the resemblance which the fond eyes trace			<br>
In all fair things to one beloved face;				<br>
In the shy touch of hands that thrill and tremble;		<br>
In looks and lips that can no more dissemble--			<br>
Thus doth Love speak.						<br><br>

How does Love speak?						<br>
In the wild words that uttered seem so weak			<br>
They shrink ashamed in silence; in the fire			<br>
Glance strikes with glance, swift flashing high and higher,	<br>
Like lightnings that precede the mighty storm;			<br>
In the deep, soulful stillness; in the warm,			<br>
Impassioned tide that sweeps through throbbing veins,		<br>
Between the shores of keen delights and pains;			<br>
In the embrace where madness melts in bliss,			<br>
And in the convulsive rapture of a kiss--			<br>
Thus doth Love speak.						<br>
