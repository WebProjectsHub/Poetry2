<hp5>
She walks in beauty, like the night			<br>
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;			<br>
And all that’s best of dark and bright			<br>
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;			<br>
Thus mellowed to that tender light			<br>
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.			<br><br>

One shade the more, one ray the less,			<br>
Had half impaired the nameless grace			<br>
Which waves in every raven tress,			<br>
Or softly lightens o’er her face;			<br>
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,			<br>
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.		<br><br>

And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,			<br>
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,				<br>
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,		<br>
But tell of days in goodness spent,			<br>
A mind at peace with all below,				<br>
A heart whose love is innocent!				<br>
