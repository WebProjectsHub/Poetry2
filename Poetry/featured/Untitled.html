I will cut off the tips of my five fingers and draw a staff with my blood.		<br>
I will be alone tonight, but I wonâ€™t be lonely.						<br>
And tonight, I will shed tears.								<br>
The first glass is for you, who left me.						<br>
The second glass is for me, who is already so pathetic.					<br>
Another glass for our eternal love.							<br>
And the last glass is for the Almighty who foresaw and decided everything in advance.	<br>
