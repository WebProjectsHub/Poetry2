Every time you leave home,		<br>
Another road takes you			<br>
Into a world you were never in.		<br><br>

New strangers on other paths await.	<br>
New places that have never seen you	<br>
Will startle a little at your entry.	<br><br>

Old places that know you well		<br>
Will pretend nothing			<br>
Changed since your last visit.		<br><br>

When you travel, you find yourself	<br>
Alone in a different way,		<br>
More attentive now			<br>
To the self you bring along,		<br>
Your more subtle eye watching		<br>
You abroad; and how what meets you	<br>
Touches that part of the heart		<br>
That lies low at home:			<br><br>

How you unexpectedly attune		<br>
To the timbre in some voice,		<br>
Opening in conversation			<br>
You want to take in			<br>
To where your longing			<br>
Has pressed hard enough			<br>
Inward, on some unsaid dark,		<br>
To create a crystal of insight		<br>
You could not have known		<br>
You needed				<br>
To illuminate				<br>
Your way.				<br><br>

When you travel,			<br>
A new silence				<br>
Goes with you,				<br>
And if you listen,			<br>
You will hear				<br>
What your heart would			<br>
Love to say.				<br><br>

A journey can become a sacred thing:	<br>
Make sure, before you go,		<br>
To take the time			<br>
To bless your going forth,		<br>
To free your heart of ballast		<br>
So that the compass of your soul	<br>
Might direct you toward			<br>
The territories of spirit		<br>
Where you will discover			<br>
More of your hidden life,		<br>
And the urgencies			<br>
That deserve to claim you.		<br><br>

May you travel in an awakened way,	<br>
Gathered wisely into your inner ground;	<br>
That you may not waste the invitations	<br>
Which wait along the way to transform you.	<br><br>

May you travel safely, arrive refreshed,	<br>
And live your time away to its fullest;		<br>
Return home more enriched, and free		<br>
To balance the gift of days which call you.	<br><br>
