Let me not to the marriage of true minds			<br>
Admit impediments. Love is not love				<br>
Which alters when it alteration finds,				<br>
Or bends with the remover to remove.				<br>
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark					<br>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;			<br>
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,				<br>
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.		<br>
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks		<br>
Within his bending sickle's compass come;			<br>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,			<br>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.			<br>
If this be error and upon me prov'd,				<br>
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.				<br>
