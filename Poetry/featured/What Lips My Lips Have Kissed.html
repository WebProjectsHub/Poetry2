What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,	<br>
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain		<br>
Under my head till morning; but the rain		<br>
Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh		<br>
Upon the glass and listen for reply,			<br>
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain		<br>
For unremembered lads that not again			<br>
Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.			<br>
Thus in winter stands the lonely tree,			<br>
Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,		<br>
Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:		<br>
I cannot say what loves have come and gone,		<br>
I only know that summer sang in me			<br>
A little while, that in me sings no more.		<br>
