The telegram says you have gone away		<br>
And left our bankrupt circus on its own;	<br>
There is nothing more for me to say.		<br><br>

The maestro gives the singing birds their pay	<br>
And they buy tickets for the tropic zone;	<br>
The telegram says you have gone away.		<br><br>

The clever woolly dogs have had their day	<br>
They shoot the dice for one remaining bone;	<br>
There is nothing more for me to say.		<br><br>

The lion and the tigers turn to clay		<br>
And Jumbo sadly trumpets into stone;		<br>
The telegram says you have gone away.		<br><br>

The morbid cobra's wits have run astray;	<br>
He rents his poisons out by telephone;		<br>
There is nothing more for me to say.		<br><br>

The colored tents all topple in the bay;	<br>
The magic saw dust writes: address unknown.	<br>
The telegram says you have gone away;		<br>
There is nothing more for me to say.		<br>
