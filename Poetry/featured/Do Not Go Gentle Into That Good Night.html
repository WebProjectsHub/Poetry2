Do not go gentle into that good night,			<br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;		<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.		<br><br>

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,	<br>
Because their words had forked no lightning they	<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.			<br><br>

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright		<br>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,	<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.		<br>

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,		<br>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,	<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.			<br><br>

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight	<br>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,		<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.		<br><br>

And you, my father, there on the sad height,		<br>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.	<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.			<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.		<br>
