It is in the small things we see it.				<br>
The child's first step, as awesome as an earthquake.		<br>
The first time you rode a bike, wallowing up the sidewalk.	<br>
The first spanking when your heart went on a journey all alone.	<br><br>

When they called you crybaby or poor or fatty or crazy		<br>
and made you into an alien,					<br>
you drank their acid and concealed it.				<br><br>

Later, if you faced the death of bombs and bullets		<br>
you did not do it with a banner,				<br>
you did it with only a hat to cover your heart.			<br>
You did not fondle the weakness inside you though it was there.	<br>
Your courage was a small coal that you kept swallowing.		<br><br>

If your buddy saved you and died himself in so doing,		<br>
then his courage was not courage, it was love;			<br>
love as simple as shaving soap.					<br><br>

Later, if you have endured a great despair,			<br>
then you did it alone,						<br>
getting a transfusion from the fire,				<br>
picking the scabs off your heart,				<br>
then wringing it out like a sock.				<br><br>

Next, my kinsman, you powdered your sorrow,			<br>
you gave it a back rub						<br>
and then you covered it with a blanket				<br>
and after it had slept a while					<br>
it woke to the wings of the roses				<br>
and was transformed.						<br><br>

Later, when you face old age and its natural conclusion		<br>
your courage will still be shown in the little ways,		<br>
each spring will be a sword you'll sharpen,			<br>
those you love will live in a fever of love,			<br>
and you'll bargain with the calendar				<br>
and at the last moment when death opens the back door		<br>
you'll put on your carpet slippers and stride out.		<br><br>
