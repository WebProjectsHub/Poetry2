No matter if you're big or small,		<br>
The hero inside you can conquer all.		<br>
Transform your mind in a positive way,		<br>
And see the improvement day by day.		<br><br>

You may not have the best support,		<br>
But cast your weakness unto God.		<br>
Each step you take requires courage,		<br>
Which leads to goals being reached.		<br><br>

Be proud of the smallest things you achieve.	<br>
It's even more reason for you to believe.	<br>
Maybe you think it's no big deal,		<br>
But through each victory something got healed.	<br><br>

Don't underestimate yourself.			<br>
There's power in your spiritual wealth.		<br>
You may be doomed by all the rest,		<br>
But you can do all, if God says yes!		<br><br>
