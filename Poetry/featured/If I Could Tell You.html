Time will say nothing but I told you so,			<br>
Time only knows the price we have to pay;			<br>
If I could tell you I would let you know.			<br><br>

If we should weep when clowns put on their show,		<br>
If we should stumble when musicians play,			<br>
Time will say nothing but I told you so.			<br><br>

There are no fortunes to be told, although,			<br>
Because I love you more than I can say,				<br>
If I could tell you I would let you know.			<br><br>

The winds must come from somewhere when they blow,		<br>
There must be reasons why the leaves decay;			<br>
Time will say nothing but I told you so.			<br><br>

Perhaps the roses really want to grow,				<br>
The vision seriously intends to stay;				<br>
If I could tell you I would let you know.			<br><br>

Suppose all the lions get up and go,				<br>
And all the brooks and soldiers run away;			<br>
Will Time say nothing but I told you so?			<br>
If I could tell you I would let you know.			<br>
