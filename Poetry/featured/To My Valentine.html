<hp5>
More than a catbird hates a cat,		<br>
Or a criminal hates a clue,			<br>
Or the Axis hates the United States,		<br>
That's how much I love you.			<br><br>

I love you more than a duck can swim,		<br>
And more than a grapefruit squirts,		<br>
I love you more than a gin rummy is a bore,	<br>
And more than a toothache hurts.		<br><br>

As a shipwrecked sailor hates the sea,		<br>
Or a juggler hates a shove,			<br>
As a hostess detests unexpected guests,		<br>
That's how much you I love.			<br><br>

I love you more than a wasp can sting,		<br>
And more than the subway jerks,			<br>
I love you as much as a beggar needs a crutch,	<br>
And more than a hangnail irks.			<br><br>

I swear to you by the stars above,		<br>
And below, if such there be,			<br>
As the High Court loathes perjurious oathes,	<br>
That's how you're loved by me.			<br><br>
