<b>Background Story of <i>"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"</i></b>
<br>
"Do not go gentle into that good night" is a poem by Dylan Thomas, first published in 1951. The poem is a villanelle, a nineteen-line poem with a strict rhyme scheme and repeated refrain. The poem is addressed to Thomas's father, who was dying of cancer at the time.
<br><br>

The poem is a powerful and moving plea to his father to rage against the dying of the light. Thomas urges his father to fight against death, to "rage, rage against the dying of the light." He reminds his father of all the things he has to live for, of all the beauty and joy in the world. He tells his father that he must not go gentle into death, but must fight it with all his strength.
<br><br>

The poem is full of vivid imagery and passionate language. Thomas uses the image of the night as a metaphor for death, and he compares the dying of the light to the extinguishing of a candle. He also uses the image of the sea to represent the life force, and he urges his father to "rage, rage against the dying of the light" like the waves crashing against the shore.
<br><br>
