<b id="structure">Structure</b><br>
The poem has a villanelle structure, which consists of five tercets (three-line stanzas) and one quatrain (four-line stanza). The first and third lines of the first tercet are repeated alternately as the last lines of the following tercets, and together as the last two lines of the quatrain. This creates a circular pattern that reflects the speaker’s obsessive thoughts and emotions.
<br><br>

<b id="form">Form</b><br>
The poem follows a fixed rhyme scheme of ABA ABA ABA ABA ABA ABAA, where A and B are the two rhymes. The poem also has a consistent meter of iambic pentameter, which means each line has five pairs of unstressed and stressed syllables. The form of the poem contrasts with the speaker’s unstable mental state and creates a sense of tension and irony.
<br><br>

<b id="rhythm">Rhythm</b><br>
The poem has a smooth and regular rhythm due to the use of iambic pentameter and rhyme. However, the rhythm is also broken by some variations, such as the use of parentheses, dashes, and enjambment (the continuation of a sentence without a pause beyond the end of a line). These variations disrupt the flow of the poem and suggest the speaker’s inner turmoil and confusion.
<br><br>

<b id="rhyme">Rhyme scheme</b><br>
The poem uses two types of rhyme: perfect rhyme and slant rhyme. Perfect rhyme is when the final vowel and consonant sounds of two words are identical, such as “dead” and “red”. Slant rhyme is when the final consonant sounds of two words are similar, but not identical, such as “insane” and “again”. The use of slant rhyme creates a sense of disharmony and uncertainty in the poem, which matches the speaker’s feelings about her lost love.
<br><br>

<b id="meter">Meter</b><br>
The poem uses iambic pentameter as its meter, which is a common meter in English poetry. Iambic pentameter gives the poem a formal and elegant tone, which contrasts with the speaker’s informal and colloquial language. The meter also creates a musical quality in the poem, which enhances the speaker’s expression of her emotions.
<br><br>

<b id="theme">Themes</b><br>
The poem explores several themes, such as love, loss, madness, imagination, and reality. The speaker questions whether her love was real or imagined, and whether she is sane or mad. She also expresses her grief and despair over losing her lover, and her desire to escape from reality by shutting her eyes. The poem also touches on the theme of religion, as the speaker rejects the existence of God and hell, and compares herself to a god-like figure who can create and destroy with her eyes.
<br><br>

<b id="diction">Diction</b><br>
The poem uses a mixture of simple and complex words, as well as some archaic words, such as “seraphim” and “topples”. The simple words create a sense of directness and clarity, while the complex words create a sense of sophistication and depth. The archaic words create a sense of distance and contrast between the speaker and her contemporary world. The poem also uses some figurative language, such as metaphors (“the stars go waltzing”), personification (“arbitrary blackness gallops in”), and hyperbole (“all the world drops dead”).
<br><br>

<b id="syntax">Syntax</b><br>
The poem uses mostly simple sentences, with some occasional use of compound sentences, such as “I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed / And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane”. The simple sentences create a sense of urgency and emphasis, while the compound sentences create a sense of complexity and detail. The poem also uses some syntactic devices, such as parentheses (“(I think I made you up inside my head)”), dashes (“God topples from the sky, hell’s fires fade:”), and repetition (“I shut my eyes”). These devices create a sense of parenthesis, pause, and reinforcement, respectively.
