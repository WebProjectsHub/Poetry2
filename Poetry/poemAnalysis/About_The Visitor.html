<b>Background Story of <i>"The Visitor"</i></b>
<br>
The poem "The Visitor" by Chong Hyon-Jong is about the arrival of a new person in one's life. The poem describes how the arrival of this person can be both daunting and exciting, and how it can force us to confront our own past and present.
<br><br>

The poem is featured in the Korean TV show "Because This is My First Life". The show is about two people who decide to live together as roommates, even though they are not romantically involved. The poem is used to explore the themes of connection, vulnerability, and the importance of accepting oneself.
<br><br>

The poem is written in three stanzas. The first stanza describes the arrival of the visitor as a "tremendous feat". This suggests that the arrival of this person is a significant event that will have a major impact on the speaker's life.
<br><br>

The second stanza describes the visitor as someone who "comes with his past and present and with his future". This suggests that the visitor is a complex and multifaceted individual who brings their own baggage with them.
<br><br>

The third stanza describes the visitor as someone who "comes with a heart that has been broken". This suggests that the visitor is someone who has been through pain and suffering, but who is still capable of love and connection.
<br><br>

The poem ends with the speaker wondering if their heart can "mimic that wind" and become a "hospitable place" for the visitor. This suggests that the speaker is open to the possibility of connection and intimacy, but that they are also aware of the risks involved.
