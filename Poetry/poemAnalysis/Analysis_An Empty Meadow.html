<b id="structure">Structure</b><br>
The poem has three stanzas, each with four lines. The first stanza describes the setting and the situation of the speaker. The second stanza expresses the speaker’s longing to forget the past lover. The third stanza shows the speaker’s hopelessness and resignation.
<br><br>

<b id="form">Form</b><br>
The poem is written in free verse, which means it does not follow a fixed rhyme scheme or meter. The poem uses enjambment, which is when a sentence or a phrase runs over to the next line without a pause or punctuation. This creates a sense of continuity and fluidity in the poem.
<br><br>

<b id="rhythm">Rhythm</b><br>
The poem has a varied rhythm, which reflects the speaker’s emotions and thoughts. The first stanza has a slow and steady rhythm, which creates a contrast with the suddenness of the sleet and the melting of the memories. The second stanza has a faster and more urgent rhythm, which shows the speaker’s desire to erase the memories of love. The third stanza has a broken and irregular rhythm, which conveys the speaker’s disillusionment and despair.
<br><br>

<b id="rhyme">Rhyme scheme</b><br>
The poem does not have a consistent rhyme scheme, but it uses some internal rhymes and slant rhymes to create sound effects. For example, in the first stanza, “waters” rhymes with “lovers” and “lie” rhymes with “meadow”. In the second stanza, “pain” rhymes with “again” and “sleet” rhymes with “needless”. In the third stanza, “meadow” rhymes with “shadow” and “river” rhymes with “futility”.
<br><br>

<b id="meter">Meter</b><br>
The poem does not have a regular meter, but it uses some variations of iambic pentameter, which is a common meter in English poetry. An iamb is a unit of two syllables, where the first syllable is unstressed and the second syllable is stressed. A pentameter is a line that has five iambs. For example, in the first line of the poem, “Sleet fell on the waters of Haecheon’s rice paddy”, there are five iambs: sleet FELL / on the WA / ters OF / hae CHEON’S / rice PAD / dy.
<br><br>

<b id="theme">Themes</b><br>
The poem explores themes such as love, loss, memory, regret, and loneliness. The poem depicts the speaker’s struggle to cope with the end of a relationship and the fading of memories. The poem also contrasts the natural elements of sleet, snowman, river, and meadow with the human emotions of pain, disillusionment, oblivion, and futility.
<br><br>

<b id="diction">Diction</b><br>
The poem uses simple and direct words that create vivid images and emotions. The poem also uses some words that have multiple meanings or associations, such as sleet, snowman, meadow, and river. These words can suggest both coldness and warmth, innocence and maturity, life and death, movement and stagnation.
<br><br>

<b id="syntax">Syntax</b><br>
The poem uses short sentences and phrases that create a sense of brevity and clarity. The poem also uses rhetorical questions, such as “How much longer must I wander along the edges of pain” and “If only I could also cross this field of futility”, which express the speaker’s doubts and wishes. The poem also uses parallelism, such as “If memories of love were sleet / Or a snowman lost in the wrong season”, which creates a comparison and contrast between two situations.
