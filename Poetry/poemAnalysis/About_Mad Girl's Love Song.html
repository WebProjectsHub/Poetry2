<b>Background Story of <i>"Mad Girl's Love Song"</i></b>
<br>
The poem "Mad Girl's Love Song" was written by Sylvia Plath in 1953, when she was a third-year undergraduate at Smith College. The poem is a villanelle, a nineteen-line poem with a repeating refrain. The refrain in "Mad Girl's Love Song" is "I knew a woman, lovely as a rose," and it is repeated in the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh lines of the poem.
<br><br>

The poem is narrated by a woman who is deeply in love with a man who does not love her back. The woman is obsessed with the man, and she imagines him everywhere she goes. She sees him in the trees, in the flowers, and even in the stars. She is driven mad by her love for him, and she eventually ends up in a mental institution.
<br><br>

The poem is often interpreted as a commentary on Plath's own struggles with mental illness. Plath herself was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and she experienced several episodes of depression and psychosis. The poem's speaker's obsession with the man could be seen as a metaphor for Plath's own obsession with her own mental illness.
<br><br>

The poem is also a powerful exploration of the themes of love, loss, and madness. The speaker's love for the man is both passionate and destructive. It drives her to madness, but it also gives her life meaning. The poem is a reminder that love can be both beautiful and dangerous.
<br><br>
