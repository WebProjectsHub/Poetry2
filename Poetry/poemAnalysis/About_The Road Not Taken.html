<b>Background Story of <i>"The Road Not Taken"</i></b>
<br>
The poem "The Road Not Taken" was written in 1915, during a time when Frost was living in England. He had been friends with the poet Edward Thomas for several years, and they would often go on walks together in the English countryside. One day, as they were walking, they came to a fork in the road. Thomas was indecisive about which road to take, and he often lamented that he should have taken the other one in retrospect.
<br><br>

Frost was amused by Thomas's indecisiveness, and he wrote the poem "The Road Not Taken" as a joke for him. However, the poem took on a deeper meaning for Frost as he thought about it more. He realized that the poem was about more than just choosing between two roads. It was also about the choices we make in life, and the importance of following our own path, even if it is not the easy path.
